        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm not the best at writing about myself so this'll be very simple, but I'm a huge music fan/record collector that also plays a lot of games. Taking so many programming courses has fried my brain a bit, so I haven't done much neat stuff in my free time, but I got really into Beat Saber and have been getting better at that. I also recently got a 3D model made, and have been playing with it in Unity to import it to VRchat, Beat Saber, and (maybe) Tony Hawk games down the line when I figure out all the needed blender addons.</p>

        <p>In the meantime here's a video of me playing beat saber I recorded sometime this weekend. I've been trying to make it a daily habit since I initially lost 30 pounds over the first 3 months I had it, and it has helped me remain active after leaving my last job.</p>

        <p>I'm hoping to use all my new coding knowledge to have fun in my free time by combining it with my other media skills to make more digital art, work on larger projects with friends, or find a job in the field that ties everything I know together!
